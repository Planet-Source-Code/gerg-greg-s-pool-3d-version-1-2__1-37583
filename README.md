### Description

Third version of "Greg's Pool 3D". New features include better playability with basic European rules for eight-ball pool and some bug-fixes. For those of You, who have not seen the previous versions, I include the original description:

"The programme is an example of a relatively simple game written in Visual Basic 5.0 with Direct3D, DirectSound, some physics and a handful of mathematics. It uses DirectX 8.0, thus appropriate libraries must be installed on Your computer in order to run the code. Techniques used in this project include: collision detection and response, matrix transformations, linear interpolations, vertex and index buffers, textured meshes, shadows, lighting and few more…"
